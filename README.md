# Modal Project
In this Project im created a **modal** window which is used on websites to get users to do or see something specific.

A good example of a modal window would be if a user made changes in a site without saving them and tried to go to another page. You can create a modal window that warns them to save their changes or else that information will be lost.

#### Key concepts covered:
* document.querySelector()
* addEventListener()
* classList.add()
* classList.remove()
